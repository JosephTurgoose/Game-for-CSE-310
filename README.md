# Game-for-CSE-310

# Overview

For this project I decided to see how far I could go making a simple game in Unity during the current school semester.  The type of game I made was helpful for learning to implement the proper math to convert vectors into rotation angles when firing the gun.

This game is very simple.  Point and click to shoot the enemies that are bombarding you.  When one is defeated, your score increases.  When one hits you, your score decreases.  The enemies have become harder to defeat the higher your score is.

As a computer scientist and software engineer, I must be skilled with a variety of tools.  Although Unity handles a lot by itself, a lot of programming still has to go into it to make a functional game.  Although I have made games in Unity before, I have never uploaded one to Github, nor have I used the rotational math I mentioned above.  If you play this game you will notice there is currently no noise, no start screen, and no game end.  This was simply a project to test my programming abilities during a short and busy time and I think it went quite well.

# Development Environment

I used Unity to make this project, with Visual Studio as my programming editor of choice.

This project was made using C#, including the packages for C# that are unique to Unity.

# Useful Websites

I didn't have to use the internet a whole lot for this project, but YouTube and Stack Overflow helped me set up Github for the project and ChatGPT helped to correct my math.

# Future Work

* Add a start menu
* Add an end to the game (including both a win end and a lose end)
* Add upgrades to the game
* Add a way to save your high score.
